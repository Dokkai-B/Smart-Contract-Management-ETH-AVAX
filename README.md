# Guessing Game DApp

## Getting Started

Guessing Game DApp is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to place bets and guess a secret number generated by a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The application is built using Solidity for the smart contract and React with Chakra UI for the frontend.

## Features

- Connect to MetaMask wallet
- Display user's Ethereum account address and balance
- Set game difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Place bets based on the selected difficulty
- Guess the secret number
- Reveal the secret number (optional)
- Error handling for invalid bets and other transaction errors

## Technologies Used

- Solidity
- Hardhat
- React.js
- Chakra UI
- Ethers.js
- MetaMask

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MetaMask extension installed in your browser

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/guessing-game-dapp.git
cd guessing-game-dapp
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Configure MetaMask

1. Open MetaMask and create a new account if you don't have one.
2. Connect MetaMask to the local Ethereum network:
    - Click on the network dropdown and select "Localhost 8545".
    - If "Localhost 8545" is not available, click on "Add Network" and configure it with the following details:
        - Network Name: Localhost 8545
        - New RPC URL: [http://localhost:8545](http://localhost:8545)
        - Chain ID: 1337

### Compile and Deploy the Smart Contract

1. Start a local Ethereum network using Hardhat:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat node
    ```

2. Open a new terminal in the project directory and deploy the smart contract:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
    ```

3. Note the contract address displayed in the terminal after deployment. Update the `contractAddress` variable in `pages/index.js` with this address.

### Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Open the Application

Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the Guessing Game DApp application.

### Usage

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Click on "Connect MetaMask" to connect your MetaMask wallet to the application.
3. Once connected, you will see your Ethereum account address and balance displayed.
4. You can now perform the following actions:
    - **Set Difficulty**: Use the slider to select the difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard). The bet range and guess range will update based on the selected difficulty.
    - **Place Bet**: Enter a bet amount within the specified range and a guess, then click "Place Bet" to place your bet.
    - **Reveal Number**: (Optional) Click "Reveal Number" to reveal the secret number after placing a bet.

### Smart Contract

The smart contract `Assessment.sol` is located in the `contracts` directory. It contains the logic for setting the game difficulty, placing bets, and revealing the secret number.

### Frontend

The frontend is built using React.js and Chakra UI. The main application file is `pages/index.js`, which handles the interaction with the smart contract using Ethers.js.
