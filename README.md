# Smart-Contract-Management-ETH-AVAX
This project demonstrates a unique Solidity smart contract with functions to check total funds, add funds, remove funds with a time-lock mechanism, transfer funds to another address, and set a time-lock for withdrawals. The values of these functions are displayed on the frontend of the application.
